## Usage

Install Finnhub, Pandas and Numpy.

```
pip install finnhub-python
```

## Something Additional
Finnhub with the most detailed [manual](https://finnhub.io/docs/api/) and real time high quality data with free account. You can access more advanced high quality data by premium account for sure.

Personally, I think the API provided by Finnhub is much better for research study than the Yahoo finance or Qlib.

If you want to do real world investment, the data from specified Exchanges or Brokers will be more helpful.
Not Financial Advise.
